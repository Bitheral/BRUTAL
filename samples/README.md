# BRUTAL Samples

Small, self-contained samples for the BRUTAL packages. Each sample is a single C# file that you can run directly with the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download), with no project file. From a fresh clone of the repository:

```sh
cd samples/Hello
dotnet run HelloGlfw.cs
```

Or from the repository root, `dotnet run samples/Hello/HelloGlfw.cs`.

The samples come in two kinds:

- **[Hello/](Hello)** has one sample per package. Each is the smallest useful starting point for that package.
- **[Demo/](Demo)** has fuller programs that combine several packages.

These samples are deliberately minimal.

### Error handling

Error handling is kept light on purpose. The samples check the failures you're likely to hit, such as a window that can't be created, a missing GPU feature or a file that doesn't exist, and let everything else throw.

## Requirements

- The [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
- Windows x64, Linux x64 or macOS on Apple silicon. The packages bundle native libraries for these three.
- **Vulkan samples:** the packages ship Brutal's own Vulkan helper library, which loads the system's Vulkan loader, and the loader then finds your GPU driver. On Windows both come with your GPU driver. On Linux, install the Vulkan loader and a driver, for example `libvulkan1` and `mesa-vulkan-drivers` on Debian or Ubuntu. On macOS, install the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home), which provides the loader and MoltenVK.
- **Windowed samples:** a desktop session. On Linux that means X11 or Wayland.
- **Audio samples:** an audio output device.
- **HelloNativeFileDialog on Linux:** GTK 3.
- **HelloFmod:** your own licensed FMOD libraries; see the file's header.
- **HelloNotCurses:** a real terminal.

## Start here

- **Foundations:** [HelloCore](Hello/HelloCore.cs), then [HelloMemory](Hello/HelloMemory.cs), [HelloCollections](Hello/HelloCollections.cs) and [HelloStrings](Hello/HelloStrings.cs).
- **Windowing:** [HelloGlfw](Hello/HelloGlfw.cs) for an empty window, then [HelloImGui](Hello/HelloImGui.cs) for debug UI.
- **Graphics:** [HelloOpenGl](Hello/HelloOpenGl.cs) for the shortest path to a triangle. For Vulkan, [HelloVulkan](Hello/HelloVulkan.cs) then [DemoVulkan](Demo/DemoVulkan.cs) for the triangle.
- **Audio:** [HelloOpenAl](Hello/HelloOpenAl.cs).
- **Physics:** [HelloBox2D](Hello/HelloBox2D.cs) or [HelloJolt](Hello/HelloJolt.cs), then their demos.
